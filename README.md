# SM-RobotArmCircuitDiagram

this is the first task from Electronics and Power Department, the design of the robot arm have 5 servo one of them for the grip

## What is the Task?
the repositories include the following tasks:
1. Design of an electronic circuit to control 5 servo motors 
2. Programming the electronic circuit so that all movements are moveing by 90 degrees

## The Arduino Parts
- 4 servo (SM-S23095)
- 1 servo (Positional)
- 1 Small Breadborad

## Connecting Servo
servos details

1. Base Servo -> digital bin 8
2. Shoulder Servo -> digital bin 9
3. Elbow Servo -> digital bin 10
4. Wrist Servo -> digital bin 11
5. gripper Servo -> digital bin 12
